# Script to remove small intersections between yarns in a textile
# This uses the interference detection implemented in TexGen and then makes
# adjustments to both yarns. Yarn area will be reduced in this process and
# may not be a true representation of the yarn behaviour.  It was intended to 
# remove very small intersections which prevented the model from running in
# FE solvers.

# Python 3 version used runpy module to execute scripts from TexGen GUI which requires import of library
from TexGen.Core import *

# Get existing textile. May need to add name as parameter if more than one textile created
textile = GetTextile()

# Create vector of CMesh and resize to number of yarns in textile
YarnMeshes = MeshVector()
NumYarns = textile.GetNumYarns()
YarnMeshes.resize(NumYarns)

# May need to adjust tolerance depending on model
Tol = 1e-6

# Create a volume mesh for each yarn, clipped to domain and add to mesh vector
Domain = textile.GetDomain()
for i in range(NumYarns):
    yarn = textile.GetYarn(i)
    yarn.AddVolumeToMesh(YarnMeshes[i], Domain)
  
# Initialise class which does the interference adjustment  
AdjustMesh = CAdjustMeshInterference()

# Mesh is only adjusted if interference is less than one volume mesh element deep
